   World Objects are synchronized in following way:
      -Assuming that there will be a lot of objects in all worlds
      -Taking that in mind, synchronizing will not exchange all object Version's
      -Instead it will exchange AreaVer.obj_ver (version of all objects in an area)
      -if local ver is different than server, then request all objects in that area from the server
      -if after syncing all objects are identical in local as from the server (including number of objects) then set local AreaVer.obj_ver to the one from server
      -in other case {if(syncing changed anything)randomize local AreaVer.obj_ver} and {send different objects from that area to the server}
      -modifying objects on the client side in world editor will make them sent individually (not its area and all objects located there, however if many objects were modified in one area, then try groupping and sending those modified objects)
   This approach is the best I could think of, alternatives are:
      -1. exchange versions for all objects in all worlds separately (this would be lots of ID's and Version's each time client is connected to Server)
      -2. modifying objects would send all objects from that area to the Server with the new AreaVer.obj_ver to somehow prevent (upon reconnecting) Server sending objects from modified areas since last time which we already have (however this would result in too big bandwidth each time an object is modified)
      -Using above approach I use least bandwitdh (the only downside is AreaVer.obj_ver is modified on the client only at connecting to Server after receiving Server data)
