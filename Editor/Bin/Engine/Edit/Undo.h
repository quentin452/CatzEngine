   Undo supports two modes:
      -Full
      -Partial

   For "Full" mode each Change must contain the entire copy of the data.

   For "Partial" mode each Change contains only information about the data that was changed,
      it is the user's responsibility to design the "Change" class to properly store that information.

   Full mode may be easier to implement, however it may use a lot more memory for big amounts of data.
