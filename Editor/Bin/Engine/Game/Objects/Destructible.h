        BREAKABLE, // this object is                 the whole DestructMesh, it uses 1 Mesh and many sleeping Actor's, this object                                    can    be broken into pieces automatically, once movement is detected on at least one of the actors, the object is automatically converted into many objects of 'PIECE' mode. This mode uses 1 Mesh and many Actors, so the cost of displaying is low, but physics processing is higher
