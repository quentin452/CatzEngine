   Use 'EsenthelStore' to communicate with Esenthel Store.
      You can use it for example if you've developed a game which is sold through Esenthel Store,
      and in the game you'd like to verify if it's a licensed copy.

      This testing can be done for example in following way:
         1. Ask the user for license key
         2. Test that license key (optionally with Device ID of the user's device)
         3. Allow to play the game only based on successful response from the Store

   'EsenthelStore' class can also be used for making In-App purchases.
