   Use 'PlatformStore' to communicate with the Platform Store, like:
      Microsoft Windows Store
      Google    Play    Store for Android
      Apple     App     Store for iOS

   In Google Play in addition to your own item ID's, you can use the following:
      "android.test.purchased"        - test purchase that will always succeed
      "android.test.canceled"         - test purchase that will always fail
      "android.test.item_unavailable" - test purchase that will always fail due to item unavailability
      "android.test.refunded"         - test purchase that will trigger item refund

   In Google Play to test your custom item ID's, make sure to run the Application:
      -in Release mode (which will force signing of the APK file)
      -on actual device (not on emulator)
      -with the same Package Name as in the store
   Otherwise testing purchases will fail with following message:
      "This version of the application is not configured for billing through Google Play"

   In Apple Store to test your custom item ID's, make sure to run the Application:
      -on actual device (not on simulator)
      -with the same Package Name as in the store
      -have your bank account details setup on iTunes Connect
      -sometimes you may need to wait a few hours after creating new items in iTunes Connect until they become available
      -make sure that the items in iTunes Connect are "Cleared for Sale"
