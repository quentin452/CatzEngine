      3. Enable Xbox Live for it
         1. Open Application Page on https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/apps-and-games/overview
         2. Select "Services \ Xbox Live" in the menu
         3. Enable Xbox Live for Application
      4. Authorize Xbox Live accounts for testing
      5. Publish configuration using the "Test" button

      Full Microsoft documentation here - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/live/get-started/live-getstarted-nav

      6. Set Xbox Live Sandbox ID in the Windows Device Portal - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal-desktop#set-up-windows-device-portal-on-a-desktop-device

      7. Configure your Application in Engine Editor
         1. Double-click your Application Element in the Project to open its properties
         2. Fill out the "Microsoft" and "XboxLive" fields (you can use "Get" buttons to navigate to Microsoft website where you can obtain these values)
